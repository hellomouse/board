github linting workflow

-----

- Apps list
- Search bar


board page:
- get search params in route

- refresh boards periodically?
- expand list of boards - show boards like channels on left
    - have list of boards be global, global refresh plugin
- when deleting board count how many pins it has + display count 
- share: if you are editor cant add users higher rank than u

- save sort preference - localstoragen
- instead of board fixed size adaptive columns

- also maybe compact left side more?
    - toggle
- autocomplete keyboard nav
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom

make board clickable - highlght on click 

- press enter in create board modal to create 

make it so editors can also update board and share
- make it so editors cant promote others to owner


pins:
- have a dropdown in new pin
    - select what type of modal to use
        - markdown is current
        - image gallery - preview images, only file upload + paste images
        - link - select link, preview
        - review - same as markdown, but add score
            - no file upload
- pin pagination
- proper sorting
- pin empty state
- always show pin details - work
- board does not exist state or board does not have permissions

cache user information for fast lookup
