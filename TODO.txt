link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?
- sse endpoint for this
- return pin updates with data?
    - only show pins user can access
    - send event data: when pin update, somehow get from ipc


refactor code
server:
- server side check length is non-zero
- cache db results?
- all the perm checks for can view - check if public can view as well
    - maybe login should be no view error
- check no race conditions in db stuff

board public - error getting users
