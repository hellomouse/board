github linting workflow

-----

- Apps list
- Search bar


board page:
- only show delete, edit, etc.. if has perms
- click on board to go
- get search params in route
- sort bar
- refresh boards periodically?
- default description in create
- expand list of boards - show boards like channels on left


refactors:
move share modal own component that uses the global share modal
- same for board delete modal
- css, ie &__sub instead of explicitly naming - check naming schemes

proper console.error

- batch user search


make nicer:
- board: loading + empty state
- also maybe compact left side more?
    - toggle

- autocomplete keyboard nav
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom




- svg logo


- modal to create pin


pins are like notes just double click to edit


responsive mobile
