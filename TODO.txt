optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?

boards:
    - mass Share

select multiple formats for download at once :D

link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?

boards folders
- only top level folders
- add tags to boards? show tags (folders) at top to search, clicking just filters by them
- drag boards to folders

later:

pfp - or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user

future todo:

    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom
