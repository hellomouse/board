github linting workflow

-----

- Apps list
- Search bar


board page:
- only show delete, edit, etc.. if has perms
- click on board to go
- get search params in route
- sort bar
- refresh boards periodically?
- default description in create
- expand list of boards - show boards like channels on left
- require login for board


- returning list of boards should return perms as well
- batch user search


- api documentation page


make nicer:
- board: loading + empty state
- also maybe compact left side more?
    - toggle

- autocomplete keyboard nav
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom
