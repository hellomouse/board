bug: http://localhost:3000/board/board?id=27f68c9e-fe2d-4e59-ba7a-e06dba2e5af5 - extends extra

- pin proper sorting
- board proper sorting



later:

pins:
- have a dropdown in new pin
    - select what type of modal to use
        - markdown is current
        - image gallery - preview images, only file upload + paste images
        - link - select link, preview
        - review - same as markdown, but add score
            - no file upload

pin create/edit modal:
    - https://github.com/MuhammedAlkhudiry/quill-find-replace-module
    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html
- for markdown pin show link for markdown guide


html stripping:
- disallow: style tags
- img: only src, width, height


board / pin api - return pfp url as well
-  cache user information for fast lookup
- or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user
