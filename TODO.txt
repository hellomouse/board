optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?

boards:
    - mass Share
    - ctrl-shift select

- link:
    - download preview image as low res maybe
        - just base64 encode maybe?
            - api to get the base64 image and info, embed in metadata
            - rust image thumbnail - maybe like 60x60
        - disable submit while generating
            - generate if untouched after a while and before submit

        - or do it async in background since expensive, implement queue
            - instead returns link the result will be at

        - get preview very slow on google, terminate after elements are found or don't log?
            - seperate the process for the web app
            - google fails to fetch preview image
            - rewrite in node.js

links:
    - download site
    - videos preview (sep component in shared or osmething)
        - save youtube metadata maybe
    - sound preview:
        - newgrounds, soundcloud
    - tweets
        - pfp, user, content, likes, retweets, time
        - see discord
        - image / video
    - reddit
    - imgur / pixiv images



later:

pin create/edit modal:
    - https://github.com/MuhammedAlkhudiry/quill-find-replace-module
    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html

pfp - or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user

copy note to board option

- option to download board

-------

future todo:

- pins: version history

better search (split words, images, dates, etc...)


responsive mobile
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom

boards folders
- only top level folders
- add tags to boards? show tags (folders) at top to search, clicking just filters by them
- move boards to folders

user settings page

track user login ip and time, invalidate sessions




----
link tree:
- per user automatic, setup with your name + pfp
- set desc
- add / remove links

- logo, favicon, add to list, meta
