optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?

boards:
    - mass Share
    - ctrl-shift select

don't override ctrl+a if in modal

- link:
    - download preview image as low res maybe
        - just base64 encode maybe?
            - api to get the base64 image and info, embed in metadata
            - rust image thumbnail - maybe like 60x60


page to watch download queue process


later:

pin create/edit modal:

    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader

future todo:

better search (split words, images, dates, etc...)


responsive mobile

- add tags to boards? show tags (folders) at top to search, clicking just filters by them
- move boards to folders
