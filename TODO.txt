github linting workflow

-----

- Apps list
- Search bar


board page:
- get search params in route

- refresh boards periodically?
- expand list of boards - show boards like channels on left
    - have list of boards be global, global refresh plugin

- share: if you are editor cant add users higher rank than u

- save sort preference - localstoragen
- instead of board fixed size adaptive columns

- also maybe compact left side more?
    - toggle
- autocomplete keyboard nav
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom


make it so editors can also update board and share
- make it so editors cant promote others to owner
