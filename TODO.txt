github linting workflow

-----

- Apps list
- Search bar


board page:
- get search params in route


- inf scroll?


- refresh boards periodically?


make board clickable - highlght on click 
    - also does selection - mass share / delete

- save sort preference - localstoragen
    - use store, also save whether side panel is open

navigating by params doesn't update the page, ie board
don't update left nav on nav

left nav board list
- - have list of boards be global, global refresh plugin
- use the infinite scroll thing?


- also maybe compact left side more?
    - toggle


- autocomplete keyboard nav
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom



pins:
- have a dropdown in new pin
    - select what type of modal to use
        - markdown is current
        - image gallery - preview images, only file upload + paste images
        - link - select link, preview
        - review - same as markdown, but add score
            - no file upload



meta tags

- double click pin to edit
- bulk delete / pin / archive / favorite / change background pins
