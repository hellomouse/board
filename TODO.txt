favorite pins
- api to add / remove bulk favorite pins
- get favorites - favorites board


switching from pin to boards shows no perm quickly



html stripping:

- img: only src, width, height



later:

pins:
- have a dropdown in new pin
    - select what type of modal to use
        - markdown is current
        - image gallery - preview images, only file upload + paste images
        - link - select link, preview
        - review - same as markdown, but add score
            - no file upload

pin create/edit modal:

    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html
- for markdown pin show link for markdown guide

board / pin api - return pfp url as well
-  cache user information for fast lookup

    - then can remove pfp url from user
