link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?
- sse endpoint for this
- return pin updates with data?
    - only show pins user can access
    - send event data: when pin update, somehow get from ipc

boards folders
- tag boards
    - board has dropdown -> edit tags -> add / remove
    - bulk add to tags - select board, add / remove to tag
        - have 1 modal:
            - board_ids to affect
            - tag groups to add / remove to
        - require bulk endpoint




loading states for other modals

make the color palette pickers better

all the perm checks for can view - check if public can view as well
- remove edit for public? since all public pins can't be edited anyways
