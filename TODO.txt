link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?
- sse endpoint for this
- return pin updates with data?
    - only show pins user can access
    - send event data: when pin update, somehow get from ipc

boards folders
- tag boards
    - board has dropdown -> edit tags -> add / remove
    - bulk add to tags - select board, add / remove to tag
        - have 1 modal:
            - board_ids to affect
            - tag groups to add / remove to
        - require bulk endpoint

- drag boards to folders
    - edit tag or something
        - bulk endpoint for diffing

- selecting folders?
    - bulk color?
        - endpoint allow specifying tags as well?

rewrite db side -> use 2nd table instead of string

- show tags on boards as well
- when creating board in folder auto add to folder
    - modify create board api to specify ids of tag groups to add to
- dont get board_ids for all folders until clicked or edit
- check for tag count limit when creating



board / tag bulk download

loading states for other modals

make the color palette pickers better

all the perm checks for can view - check if public can view as well
- remove edit for public? since all public pins can't be edited anyways

isolate files in iframe or something

puppeteer ublock origin

why does boards page change height


server side check length is non-zero

dompurify output of downloaded sites

share modal / edit board modal - loading state, open immedately while loading

    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html
    - https://github.com/c-w/mathquill4quill

pfp - or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user


- option to download board

-------

future todo:

better search (split words, images, dates, etc...)

optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?

responsive mobile
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom

----
link tree:
- per user automatic, setup with your name + pfp
- set desc
- add / remove links

- logo, favicon, add to list, meta

----

general

user settings page

track user login ip and time, invalidate sessions

persist sessions across server restart
