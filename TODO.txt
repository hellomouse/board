link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?
- sse endpoint for this
- return pin updates with data?
    - only show pins user can access
    - send event data: when pin update, somehow get from ipc


refactor code
server:
- server side check length is non-zero
- cache db results?
- all the perm checks for can view - check if public can view as well
    - maybe login should be no view error



login redirect back to board keep query params as well!

future todo:

better search (split words, images, dates, etc...)

optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?

responsive mobile
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom

better light mode

- set desc
- add / remove links

- logo, favicon, add to list, meta
