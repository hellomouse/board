bug: "could not get board" flickers before loading in


board:
- left nav scroll
- same for adding


- pin proper sorting
- board proper sorting



later:

pins:
- have a dropdown in new pin
    - select what type of modal to use
        - markdown is current
        - image gallery - preview images, only file upload + paste images
        - link - select link, preview
        - review - same as markdown, but add score
            - no file upload

pin create/edit modal:
    - https://github.com/MuhammedAlkhudiry/quill-find-replace-module
    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html
- for markdown pin show link for markdown guide


html stripping:
- disallow: style tags
- img: only src, width, height


board / pin api - return pfp url as well
-  cache user information for fast lookup
- or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user

boards:
    - right click menu -> change color there?
    - also does selection - mass Share

responsive mobile
