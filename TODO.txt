github linting workflow

-----

- Apps list
- Search bar


board page:
- click on board to go
- get search params in route
- sort bar
- refresh boards periodically?
- default description in create
- expand list of boards - show boards like channels on left
- require login for board


make it so editors can also update board and share
- make it so editors cant promote others to owner


- batch user search

wip:
- api documentation page
- table of contents for docs on right somehow



[Vue warn]: Do not use built-in or reserved HTML elements as component id: menu                                                10:42:02 AM
[Vue warn]: Property "showModal" was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.


make nicer:
- board: loading + empty state
- also maybe compact left side more?
    - toggle
- autocomplete keyboard nav
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom
