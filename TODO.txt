optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?


going from board -> pin triggers board update first

link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?
- sse endpoint for this
- return pin updates with data?
    - only show pins user can access
    - send event data: when pin update, somehow get from ipc

boards folders
- only top level folders
- add tags to boards? show tags (folders) at top to search, clicking just filters by them
- drag boards to folders
- uhhh selecting folders??

copy note to board option

later:

    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html
    - https://github.com/c-w/mathquill4quill

pfp - or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user


- option to download board

-------

future todo:

- pins: version history

better search (split words, images, dates, etc...)

responsive mobile
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom

persist sessions across server restart

----
link tree:
- per user automatic, setup with your name + pfp
- set desc
- add / remove links

- logo, favicon, add to list, meta

----

general

user settings page

track user login ip and time, invalidate sessions
