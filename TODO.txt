link tags - periodically refresh or hide link preview if not rendered?
- sse endpoint for this
- return pin updates with data?
    - only show pins user can access
    - send event data: when pin update, somehow get from ipc


refactor code
server:
- proper refs
- rename all parameter names consistent
- server side check length is non-zero


loading states for other modals

make the color palette pickers better

all the perm checks for can view - check if public can view as well
- remove edit for public? since all public pins can't be edited anyways



share modal / edit board modal - loading state, open immedately while loading


downloader:
    isolate files in iframe or something
    puppeteer ublock origin
    dompurify output of downloaded sites

----
later:

pin create/edit modal:
    - https://github.com/MuhammedAlkhudiry/quill-find-replace-module
    - https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader
    - https://vueup.github.io/vue-quill/guide/modules.html
    - https://github.com/c-w/mathquill4quill

pfp - or just make /pfp/username.png or something
    - then can remove pfp url from user


- option to download board
    - board / tag bulk download

-------

future todo:

better search (split words, images, dates, etc...)

optimization: when sending content allow sending diff?

responsive mobile
- fix share modal on phone
    - different ui on phone - click on user to show dropdown popped from bottom

----
link tree:
- per user automatic, setup with your name + pfp
- set desc
- add / remove links

- logo, favicon, add to list, meta

----

general

user settings page

track user login ip and time, invalidate sessions

persist sessions across server restart
