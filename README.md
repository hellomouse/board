Hellomouse Apps is an app suite for Hellomouse. Currently we have the following apps:
- **Board:** A pinterest / notes app for archiving websites, images, or just your own ideas, under `/board`.
   - Create boards and pins and share them with other users / the public
   - Create pins with text formatting, checklists, images, or link previews
   - Archive websites with a single click (save as HTML, PDF, special handling for some sites)
- **Link:** A linktree clone with style support for hundreds of sites
- **Docs:** Documentation for the app suite API under `/docs`
- **Site:** Dashboard to view site archive tasks
- **Music:** Music player with auto-download support for sites like Youtube, Bilibili, Soundcloud, etc...

### Other Components
These will also need to be installed for the app to function.
